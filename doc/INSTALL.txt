BUILDING
~~~~~~~~

Unix
~~~~
qmake -r
make

Use "make distclean" to return to clean state.

Windows
~~~~~~~
qmake -r
nmake

Use "nmake distclean" to return to clean state.

TESTING
~~~~~~~

Execute the "qdecimal_test" application in the bin directory.
To execute the subset of the tests, just run
"qdecimal_test --test_dir=tc_subset".

Full test would have only 2 expected (fma) failures, whereas subset 
test should not have any failure.
