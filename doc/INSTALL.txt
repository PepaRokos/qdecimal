BUILDING
~~~~~~~~

Unix
~~~~
qmake -r
make

Use "make clean" to clean up intermediate (object etc.) files.
Use "make distclean" to return to clean state.

Windows
~~~~~~~
qmake -r
nmake

Use "nmake clean" to clean up intermediate (object etc.) files.
Use "nmake distclean" to return to clean state.

TESTING
~~~~~~~

Execute the "qdecimal_test" application in the bin directory.
To execute the subset of the tests, just run
"qdecimal_test --test_dir=tc_subset".

Full test would have only 2 expected (fma) failures, whereas subset 
test should not have any failure.

SHARED LIBRARY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
a) Command "CONFIG += static" line and uncomment the two lines 
beginning with "CONFIG += shared"
in src/src.pro file.

b) In the client applications simply define QDECIMAL_SHARED macro;
that is "DEFINES += QDECIMAL_SHARED"

c) At run-time PATH (Windows) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Unix) environment
variables should be specified to locate the shared library.
